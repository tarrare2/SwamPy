<h3>Poor quality frontend for CrocDB</h3>
This program is shoddy but at least you can start it up from ES-DE. 

It has an option to extract the games according to Emulation Station's folder mapping.

It's not the worst thing ever, provided you don't look at the source code.

If you think of a good feature to add, feel free to open up an issue.
